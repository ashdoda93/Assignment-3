# Assignment-3

Program three options:

option 1: Queue data structure demo

option 2: Linear search for last occurrence in a vector demo

option 3: Insertion sort demo

Once program is started user will be presented with the following console:

User will then input an integer followed by enter. User will repeat this until ten integers have been inputted.

Once user has input ten integers program will display queue contents, front element, and queue size. Program will then move front element to the back of the queue, and proceed to display new queue contents.

User will then be presented with the following console:

User will then input integers for a vector. 

User will input integers with a space in between. 

Once user has input sufficient integers user will then input a non-integer and hit enter.

User will then be presented with the following console:

<img width="1101" height="189" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/159d335e-9e93-4043-bb3e-4a5cd2a2678c" />

User will then be asked to input the target value they are searching for in the vector followed by enter.

If user inputs a target value not in vector user will be presented with the following console:

<img width="1098" height="253" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b9dacf-358f-4a09-82d3-7d0ef2ebcfc7" />

If user inputs n/N program will return to main menu.

If user inputs y/Y program will request input for another target value search with the same vector.

If user inputs a target value that is in the vector the user will be presented with the following console:

<img width="1097" height="419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9617b37f-8506-4513-9994-9d9301263248" />

User will be asked to input with integers to add to the queue.

User will input integers with a space in between.

Once user has added sufficient integers user will enter a non-integer followed by enter.

Program will output the current queue contents, the queue size, and the sorted queue contents.

Program will then return to main menu.

User will be presented with the following console:

<img width="1102" height="478" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17ed0b7f-c58e-48de-a959-2aa12dfa75a7" />
